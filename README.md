## Useful functions to use whenbuilding functions:

Certainly! Here's a list of some commonly used methods available on JavaScript's Array.prototype. These methods allow you to manipulate, iterate, and perform various operations on arrays:

forEach(callbackFn, thisArg): Calls a provided function once for each element in the array.

map(callbackFn, thisArg): Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.

filter(callbackFn, thisArg): Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

reduce(callbackFn, initialValue): Applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.

reduceRight(callbackFn, initialValue): Similar to reduce, but works from right to left in the array.

some(callbackFn, thisArg): Checks if at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function.

every(callbackFn, thisArg): Checks if all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.

find(callbackFn, thisArg): Returns the first element in the array that passes the test implemented by the provided function.

findIndex(callbackFn, thisArg): Returns the index of the first element in the array that passes the test implemented by the provided function.

indexOf(searchElement, fromIndex): Returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it's not present.

lastIndexOf(searchElement, fromIndex): Returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it's not present.

includes(searchElement, fromIndex): Checks if the array contains a certain element, returning true or false.

slice(start, end): Returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array selected from start to end (end not included).

splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...): Changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.

concat(array1, array2, ...): Returns a new array comprised of this array joined with other arrays or values.

join(separator): Creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array, separated by the specified separator string.

sort(compareFn): Sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array.

reverse(): Reverses the elements in the array in place.

isArray(value): Checks if the given value is an array.

Remember that these are just some of the most commonly used methods on the Array.prototype. There are more methods available as well, so it's always a good idea to refer to the official JavaScript documentation for a comprehensive list and detailed explanations.
